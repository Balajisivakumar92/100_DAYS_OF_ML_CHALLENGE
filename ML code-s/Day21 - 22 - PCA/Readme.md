## What is Principal Component Analysis?
  First of all Principal Component Analysis is a good name. It does what it says on the tin. PCA finds the principal components of data.
  
  It is often useful to measure data in terms of its principal components rather than on a normal x-y axis. So what are principal components then? They’re the underlying structure in the data. They are the directions where there is the most variance, the directions where the data is most spread out. This is easiest to explain by way of example. Here’s some triangles in the shape of an oval:
